# Taiwan's Daily COVID-19 Vaccination Stats
 
Open data on Taiwan's vaccination, as TW CDC is currently only publishing it as [daily PDF reports](https://www.cdc.gov.tw/Category/Page/9jFXNbCe-sFK9EImRRi2Og). We are working on making all of CDC's vaccination data accessible.
 
## Daily stats by vaccine type in [`data`](data)

Daily and cumulative stats for each type of vaccine, including the breakdown of 1st vs 2nd shots. 

We use the common vaccines names used by Taiwanese in the data headers:
* AZ: Oxford/AstraZeneca
* BNT: Pfizer-BioNTech
* Moderna
* 高端: Medigen (MVC-COV1901)
* 聯亞: Vaxxinity/UBI (UBI-612)
